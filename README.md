# ClassiPY Images
Automatic Image labeler. *Automagically* adds the following to ALL images in a folder. 
1. A classification banner.
2. The corresponding classification to the file name.
3. A small black border to the image.<br>
The labeled images are then all dumped into a folder on the desktop. Works on .JPG and .PNG

## Installation
Requirements:  
```
Python3
```
```
pip3 install wand
```
## Directions
Each Classipy script runs from it's current directory and outputs to the desktop. Therefore place the script into your folder with screenshots.  
If you'd like you can edit the files to make the directories different and/or hardcoded.  

That's it! Just remember to make the file executable.
## Usage
